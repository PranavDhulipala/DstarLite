## Overview

This is a simple path planner implemetation in C++ .


The project's objective is to implement a simple path planner namely D* lite which has been very much popular with mobile robot and autonomous vehicle navigation. The problem includes a robot with a known goal position in an unknown terrain and the robot must navigate to the goal avoiding the obstacles. The robot initially assumes that the map is free from obstacles and plans the shortest path from goal to the start position, whenever it comes across a new obstacle which it had no idea about before it adds the information to the map and re-plans a new path from the current position to goal or determine if it is not possible to reach the goal.Planning of a new path when the number of obstacles is high is a bit difficult so to avoid this risk we use incremental heuristics in which the distance to goal is approximated this makes the search focused and build the new solution upon previous solutions. D* Lite can also be used to map the surroundings of a mobile robot, this is done by discretizing the terrain into cells with uniform resolution and then moving the robot from its current cell to the closest cell with unknown traversability, until the terrain is mapped. The assumptions made in this implementation is that the map is a graph with variable edge weights initially the edge weights are set to one but if an obstacle is encountered the edge weight changes to infinity , to illustrate this consider a robot in an environment with obstacles the shortest path between the start and goal would not necessarily be a straight line as generally expected this is because the movement of the robot depends on the location of the obstacles i.e. a cost is associated with the robotâ€™s movement which will imply that straight line is not always the best solution. Another assumption would be to limit the movement of the robot i.e. the robot can only move in a 4 or 8 connected graph.

Algorithm:
- D* Lite

## Features

The D* Lite algorithm reuses information from previous searches to adapt to dynamic changes in the graph. It also uses heuristics to focus the search and to determine which nodes need to be examined. The algorithm uses g value to indicate the cost from the startnode and h value to approximate the cost to the end node for each node s. To update the changes in the graph D* Lite uses rhs which is one step look ahead value of g. Generally rhs=0 if s is the goal node or the minimum value of g(s)+c(s,s') of the predecessors and c(s,s') is the cost to move from the node s to s'.The computePath method expands each vertex at most twice, namely at most once when it is locally underconsistent and at most once when it is locally overconsistent , and thus terminates. A node is said to be underconsistent when its g value is less than its rhs value. When a node is found to be underconsistent that means that the path to that node was made to be more expensive. One can imagine this to be equivalent to an appearance of an obstacle in the path. The nodes found to be underconsistent are reset and the path is completely recalculated. A node is said to be overconsistent if its g value is greater than its rhs value. When a path is found to be overconsistent that means that the path to that node was made to be less expensive. This can be visualized as discovering a short cut,or that an obstruction is cleared. A priority queue is used to sort the nodes based on their key values. Key is a touple given by min(g,rhs)+h;min(g,rhs).These keys are compared lexicographically and a key u is less than v if if the u.first is less than v.first OR u.first == v.first AND u.second is less than v.second. After computePath one can then follow a shortest path from start to goal by always moving from the current vertex to any successor which minimizes c(s,s')+g(s') until the goal is reached.
